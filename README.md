2. View a list of all bookmarks in condensed form (title and rating)
3. Expand individual bookmarks to view the description, a link to the page, and the delete bookmark option
4. If any errors are encountered the user will be provided with a helpful message about the error
5. Users may filter their bookmark list by rating

Stack:
